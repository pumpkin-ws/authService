API interfaces:
The user interfaces are integrated in the class AuthInterface. The functionalities provided are as follows:
    -createUser: create and store username and password in memory, password is encrypted by AES
    -removeUser: remove user traces from database, including username, password, role, and token
    -createRole: function to create new role and store in memory. Each role is unique, multiple creation of the same
                 role will not change role database.
    -removeRole: remove a role. The users assigned the role will lose the role.
    -assignUserRole: assign a role to a user, will fail if role or user does not exist.
    -getUserToken: Get an AES encrypted string if the username and password are correct, the encrypted contains info
                   of the system time when the token is generated
    -invalidateToken: Remove token
    -checkRole: check if a user token has a certain role, encrypted token will be decrypted into username and time.
    -getAllRole: get all roles for the passed in user token

Class Designs:
    -UserGroup

    -RoleGroup
        Contains a hashmap to store

    -TokenGroup
        The user name and

    -StringEncryption
        Uses Advance Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt and decrypt strings. Provide methods to generate secret code,
        encrypt string, and decrypt string. The passwords and the user tokens are encrypted by this class.


In consideration of data structures:
    The four primary data types stored are users, passwords, roles, and authentication tokens. As the amount of user
    grows, searching by iteration (at least O(n) complexity, depending how iterations are performed) will become a very
    time consuming process. Hashmaps and hashsets with close to O(1) search complexity are ideal for handling large,
    unique datasets. Some thoughts on the relations of the primary data types help with constructing meaningful mapping
    relations, as follows:
        -The username and the password are one to one mapping, and only the username can be used to query password,
         not vice versa. So a hashmap with username as key and password as value. This is the case of a one way query.

        -The role-to-user relation is a one-to-many mapping. One role can correspond to many usernames. So a key of
        role mapping to a list of usernames can be a good choice, which we can use a hashmap with role as the key and
        list of users as the value.

        -The token-to-user relation is a one-to-one mapping. Each user can only have one token. Usernames are used to
         query tokens, and vice versa. After some research, cannot find a standard container that can achieve
         this mapping relation. So two hashmaps (many-to-one mapping) are used to emulate the one-to-one relation. When
         updating username or token, both hashmaps will need to update.

        -During removal of role and tokens, it can be disastrous having to iterate through each user, if there are
         billions of users. Therefore, roles and tokens must not be assigned naively as a property of an user object.

Spring boot controllers:
The spring boot program can be started from the Application class. (Need to start server to host the request services?)
    -createUser: Request to create user, with username and password passed in as POST request
    -removeUser: Request to remove user, with username passed in as POST request
    -createRole: Request to create role, with name of role passed in a POST request
    -removeRole: Request to remove role, with name of role passed in a POST request
    -assignUserRole: Request to assign role to user, with username and role passed in as POST request
    -getUserToken: Request to get user token, with username and password passed in as POST request
    -invalidateToken: Request to invalidate token, with token passed in as POST request
    -checkRole: Request to check if a user token has a certain role, with user token and role passed in as POST request
    -getAllRoles: Request to get all roles given a user token, with the user token passed in as POST request
